------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is inactive.

It is a project for providing fixtures for mocking requests.

However, we have discovered that [the rsponses project](https://github.com/getsentry/responses) is quite good.

Please, try responses first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [old README](old_README.md) is still around, if the above note hasn't discouraged you.

Cheers,
Brian
